Problem 1324

Print Words Vertically

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/print-words-vertically/

Problem Description (verbatim):

Given a string s. Return all the words vertically in the same order in which they appear in s.
Words are returned as a list of strings, complete with spaces when is necessary. (Trailing spaces are not allowed).
Each word would be put on only one column and that in one column there will be only one word.

Examples:

```
Input: s = "HOW ARE YOU"
Output: ["HAY","ORO","WEU"]
Explanation: Each word is printed vertically. 
 "HAY"
 "ORO"
 "WEU"
```

```
Input: s = "TO BE OR NOT TO BE"
Output: ["TBONTB","OEROOE","   T"]
Explanation: Trailing spaces is not allowed. 
 "TBONTB"
 "OEROOE"
 "   T"
```

Solution with explanation (100% speed, 100% memory)

First thing we have to notice is that we're working with each word in the input string directly, split by spaces. So our first order of business would be to split the input string by spaces and store it in an array or a list.
 
Depending on your language of choice, there are many ways of doing this. In the case of C++, one way is to initialize an input stringstream with this input string, and keep pushing words out of the stringstream one by one until it's empty. This works because input stringstreams delimit by spaces, meaning the end of a string can be denoted by a space in a stringstream. The code for this would be like so (in C++):

```c++
vector<string> wordList;
istringstream sstream(s);
int maxLength = 0;
do {
    string word;
    sstream>>word;
    wordList.push_back(word);
    maxLength = max(maxLength, int(word.length()));
} while(sstream);
```
This will store all the words as separate items in your "wordList" array

Notice that we're finding the length of the maximum word here as well. I will explain why we need that later on. 

For python, it's as simple as: 
```python
matrix = [word for word in s.split()]
maxWordLength = max([len(word) for word in matrix])
```

Once your word matrix (since this is technically a 2D array of individual characters) is ready, we want to store these words in a new list by reading them in column wise order instead of row wise order. Each word currently exists on a single row. Our code will walk through column 0 and take all the letters there to form one word and store it, then walk through column 1 and take all the letters there to form another word and store it and so on, until we have run out of columns. 

**Since we want to include all the letters, the number of columns will be the length of the longest word**. For words that are shorter than this, we will use spaces instead.

To accomplish this, we have two options. We can either manually extend the shorter words in the matrix by adding spaces at their end, or we can add spaces at the end on the fly while we're transferring them to the final resultant list which we will return. 
I will show both approaches. 

Approach 1, adding spaces on the fly (C++)
```C++
vector<string> toReturn;
int rows = wordList.size();
int cols = maxLength;

for(int col = 0; col<cols; col++) {
    string ans = "";
    for(int row = 0; row<rows; row++) {
        if(col<wordList[row].length()){
            ans+=wordList[row][col];
        } else {
            ans+=" ";
        }
    }
```

Here, the number of rows is just the number of words, while the number of columns we want to walk through is the length of the longest word. Once we have that set up, for each column, we will start by building an empty string (ans). This will be the word we add to our final list (toReturn). So for each column, we traverse through all the rows in that column, and add each letter to the word we're building. If a row does not have any characters on the column we're at (if the original word on this row is not as long as the longest word), we will insert a space instead, which is what we accomplish with:
```C++
if(col<wordList[row].length()){
    ans+=wordList[row][col];
} else {
    ans+=" ";
}
```

The other approach is to add spaces to the word directly in the matrix itself, which can be done like so in Python:
```Python
for index, word in enumerate(matrix):
  matrix[index]+=" "*(maxWordLength - len(word))
```
What we're doing here is taking a word in the matrix, and extending it with as many spaces as the difference in its length and the maximum length possible in the matrix.

Finally, we want to trim the spaces from the right of this word, and add it to our final list. Since C++ does not have an inbuilt function to do this, one way could be to start from the left of the string, and find the first occurence of a non-space, and take everything before that as our word. This can be done using the substr() function as show below: 
```C++
    int trimFrom = ans.size() - 1;
    while(ans[trimFrom] == ' ')
        trimFrom--;
    toReturn.push_back(ans.substr(0, trimFrom + 1));
}
```

In our Python code, on the other hand, we now need to take the letters from each column, put them together, and strip the spaces on the right, and return them as a list, which can be done in this line: 

```Python
return ["".join(i).rstrip() for i in zip(*matrix)]
```

What's happening here? You can think of zip(*matrix) as returning a transposed form of "matrix" (converts rows to columns and vice-versa, and puts them together). Now, each column is a row (list) of characters, which we put together with the "".join() function, and strip of spaces with the .rstrip() function. 

So in the end, your final C++ code will look like: 
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> printVertically(string s) {
        vector<string> wordList;
        istringstream sstream(s);
        int maxLength = 0;
        do {
            string word;
            sstream>>word;
            wordList.push_back(word);
            maxLength = max(maxLength, int(word.length()));
        } while(sstream);
        vector<string> toReturn;
        int rows = wordList.size();
        int cols = maxLength;
        
        for(int col = 0; col<cols; col++) {
            string ans = "";
            for(int row = 0; row<rows; row++) {
                if(col<wordList[row].length()){
                    ans+=wordList[row][col];
                } else {
                    ans+=" ";
                }
            }
            int trimFrom = ans.size() - 1;
            while(ans[trimFrom] == ' ')
                trimFrom--;
            toReturn.push_back(ans.substr(0, trimFrom + 1));
        }
        return toReturn;
    }
};
```

And your final Python code will look like: 
```Python
class Solution:
    def printVertically(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        matrix = [word for word in s.split()]
        maxWordLength = max([len(word) for word in matrix])
        for index, word in enumerate(matrix):
            matrix[index]+=" "*(maxWordLength - len(word))
        return ["".join(i).rstrip() for i in zip(*matrix)]
```


Complexity analysis:

n = total length of input string

First, space complexity. 

Python

Notice that even though we are using extra matrices to store our intermediate results, the total number of characters stored is not appreciably more than the number of characters in the original string itself. There is extra memory used when we append spaces to each word, which may increase quite a bit in edge cases like: "a e i o u disestablishmentarianism", because in this case, each individual letter word ("a", "e"...) will be increased in length to match the length of "disestablishmentarianism", which in the worst case can  make your space complexity approach (in our python approach of appending spaces) to O(n<sup>2</sup>). How? If half the string is one word, and the rest of it is single letter words, the total space would be (number of words)*(length of max word) = (n/2)*(n/2) approx.

How do we know this is the worst case? Mathematically, the product of two numbers that sum up to certain numbers is highest when the numbers are closest to each other. In other words, given the sum 12, the product of 6 and 6 will have a higher value than all the other pairs. Try it out yourself!


However, for the average case, you'd be near the same number of characters as the input string itself, so space complexity of your average case will be O(n). 

C++

Here, we build each word individually while adding spaces, and then that word is destroyed after we start the next iteration of the loop, we our space complexity will alwasy be near O(n)


Next, time complexity

Python

Once again, in python, for the same reasons as above, your time complexity in the worst case can go upto O(n<sup>2</sup>), but will stay near O(n) for the average case.

C++

In C++, unlike space complexity, each individual word being processed counts, so again, your time complexity may go upto O(n<sup>2</sup>), but will stay near O(n) for the average case.

So to sum up:

Time complexity: 

  O(n) - Average

  O(n<sup>2</sup>) - Worsrt
  
Space complexity: 
  
  O(n) - Average
  
  O(n<sup>2</sup>) - Worst
